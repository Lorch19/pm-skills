# /code-review

Review code changes with a structured lens on security, performance, correctness, and maintainability.

## Review Dimensions

### Security
- SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, secrets in code, SSRF, path traversal

### Performance
- N+1 queries, memory allocations, O(n²) in hot paths, missing indexes, resource leaks

### Correctness
- Edge cases (empty, null, overflow), race conditions, error handling, off-by-one

### Maintainability
- Naming clarity, single responsibility, duplication, test coverage

## Tips

1. **Provide context** — "This is a hot path" or "This handles PII"
2. **Specify concerns** — "Focus on security" narrows the review
3. **Include tests** — I'll check test coverage too
