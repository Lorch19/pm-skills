# /pipeline-review

Analyze pipeline health with prioritized actions.

## What I Accept

- CSV export from CRM
- Pasted deal list
- Verbal description of pipeline

## Pipeline Health Score (0-100)

Scored across 4 dimensions:
- **Stage progression** — Are deals moving?
- **Activity recency** — When was last touch?
- **Close date accuracy** — Are dates realistic?
- **Contact coverage** — Multi-threaded or single-threaded?

## Prioritization Weights

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Close Date | 30% |
| Deal Size | 25% |
| Stage | 20% |
| Activity | 15% |
| Risk | 10% |
